## Description
- **align_seqs_better.py**
    - Align two DNA sequences by sliding the shorter across the longer and scoring matches. Records *all* equally-best alignments, saves a human-readable report and a pickle file.  
    - If no paths are provided, the script will try ./data/seq1.fasta and ./data/seq2.fasta. If those are missing, it falls back to two built-in example sequences so it still runs.  
    - Outputs (created under ./results/):  
        - alignment_results.txt : human-readable summary  
        - alignment_results.pkl : python pickle with the full results dict  


- **align_seqs_fasta.py**
    - This has multiple functions to import and find the best alignment of two files, which are expected to be in the csv format   
    - In the main argument which calls all of these functions allows for the user to provide 2 files to align or to use two built-in defaults  
    - Output: "aligned_seq.txt" that contains best alignment and written to the results folder
